A mini text game i made in my free time.

How to play:

Download a C++ compiler 
Then copy paste the code then the controls is this:
Type door or drawer to make action. I wont say to 
You how to win, but really its up to you.

For Java: use a JAVA compiler same controls but warning 
The java code is only translated so expect some errors
